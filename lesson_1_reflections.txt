How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see in which line there were changes and hence where to look for a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can make small incremental changes and see which one leads to a bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have to remember to commit, but you get more logical history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different applications - different needs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log - history of changes (comments), git diff - what has changed (comparison)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can bring back the old version if it breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
